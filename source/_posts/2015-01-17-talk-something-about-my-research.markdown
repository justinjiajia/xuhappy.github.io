I am a postgraduate student and therefore research plays a very important role in my current life. My research interests mainly include cloud computing, decentralised social network, graph algorithms and machine learning. 

My first research project is motivated from the simple and heuristic-based speculative execution approach under the MapReduce framework. Since the previous work lacks the theoretical understanding, I consider to tackle this issue from the perspective of system modelling.
